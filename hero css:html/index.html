			Early life of Luke SkyWalker
			</h2>
			<p>
			In Skywalker's early life, he worked on a moisture farm with his aunt and uncle. One day he bought 2 droids, named R2-D2 and C-3PO. R2-D2 showed him a message that was a call for help. It was asking for Obi-Won Kanobi. Luke set out and found Obi-Wan, but when he returned, his house was destroyed. He decided to let Obi-Wan teach him to become a Jedi.

	<!-- Jedi Training -->
			<h2>To become a jedi.</h2>
			<p>Becoming a Jedi Isn't easy though. Luke had to learn many things about the force. He had two teachers that helped him a lot in becoming a Jedi. They were Yoda and Obi-Wan Kanobi. Though these teachers wern't able to keep Skywalker on dagobah when he went away to help his friends. He also learned that Leia was his sister!</p>
